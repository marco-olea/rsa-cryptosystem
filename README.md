# RSA Encrypter/Decrypter

This project uses no third-party libraries for cryptography-related functions (primality tests,
probabilistic prime number searches, number theory-related things like the euclidean algorithm,
gcd, modular inverse, square-and-multiply algorithm, etc). These have been implemented from scratch.
