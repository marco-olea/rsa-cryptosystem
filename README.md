# RSA Encrypter/Decrypter

My implementation of the RSA algorithm for encrypting and decrypting strings of text. <br/>
Written in Python 3.7.1.

This project uses no third-party libraries for cryptography-related functions (primality tests,
probabilistic prime number searches, number theory-related things like the euclidean algorithm,
gcd, modular inverse, square-and-multiply algorithm, etc). These have been implemented from scratch.
